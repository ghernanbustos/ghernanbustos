My name is Guillermo Bustos; I am an electronic engineer from Argentina - CÃ³rdoba Province. 
I have been working on my PhD thesis in a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Laboratory (LaRTE) in the National University of Cordoba. 
I am interested in sharing information about Data Science using Matlab, designing Hardware and software for Embedded Systems 
working with Altium Designer, VHDL, and ANSI C programming languages. During my thesis, I developed Hardware and software using 
System on Chip to program a Pulse Generator to sequence NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) experiments.
