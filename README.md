Hi, my name is Guillermo Bustos; I am an electronic engineer from Argentine - CÃ³rdoba Province. 
I have been working on my PhD thesis in a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Laboratory (LaRTE) in the National University of Cordoba. 
I am interested on shearing information about Data Science using Matlab, designing Hardware and software for Embedded Systems 
working with Altium designer, VHDL and ANSI C programming languages. During my thesis, 
I have to develope Hardware and software using DE0 Nano SoC kits from Terasic to program a Pulse Generator 
to sequence NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) experiments.
